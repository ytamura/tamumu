	<p>
	This is an attempt at updating my familiarity with html/css, which I first got exposed to in 2002 <strike>(wow, <a href="http://web1.caryacademy.org/facultywebs/gray_rushin/StudentProjects/CompoundWebSites/2002/SodiumCyanide/default.htm" target="_blank">it's still there</a>!)</strike>, back when frames were cool. Needless to say, I have a ton of catch up to do, but I'm hoping that my non-web engineering experiences will help me along the way.
	</p>

	<p>At the same time, it's been a good motivator to update my "portfolio" of a wide variety of "artwork" I've collected over the times. It's all over the place in terms of quality, media, and age!
	</p>

	<p>
	This site is merely a portal right now, so it's just linking to folders on my deviantART <a href="http://tamumu61.deviantart.com/gallery/" target="_blank">gallery</a>, which by the way, is a bit painful to navigate. There will be a day when all that stuff will be presented neatly on this site...
	</p>

	<p>'Til then,
